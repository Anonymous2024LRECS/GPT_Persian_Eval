"in the heat and sands of India, the mud and swamp of Africa, the purlieus of London, wherever in short the climate or the devil tempts men to fall from the true belief which is her own is even now engaged in dashing down shrines, smashing idols, and setting up in their place her own stern countenance."
Conversion is her name
"she feasts on the wills of the weakly, loving to impress, to impose, adoring her own features stamped on the face of the populace."
At Hyde Park Corner on a tub she stands preaching;
"shrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love through factories and parliaments; offers help, but desires power;"
"smites out of her way roughly the dissentient, or dissatisfied; bestows her blessing on those who, looking upward, catch submissively from her eyes the light of their own."
"This lady too Rezia Warren Smith divined it had her dwelling in Sir William's heart, though concealed, as she mostly is, under some plausible disguise; some venerable name; love, duty, self sacrifice."
How he would work
"how toil to raise funds, propagate reforms, initiate institutions!"
"But conversion, fastidious Goddess, loves blood better than brick, and feasts most subtly on the human will."
"For example, Lady Bradshaw."
Fifteen years ago she had gone under.
"It was nothing you could put your finger on; there had been no scene, no snap; only the slow sinking, water logged, of her will into his."
"Sweet was her smile, swift her submission; dinner in Harley Street, numbering eight or nine courses, feeding ten or fifteen guests of the professional classes, was smooth and urbane."
"Only as the evening wore on a very slight dulness, or uneasiness perhaps, a nervous twitch, fumble, stumble and confusion indicated, what it was really painful to believe"
that the poor lady lied.
"Once, long ago, she had caught salmon freely:"
"now, quick to minister to the craving which lit her husband's eye so oilily for dominion, for power, she cramped, squeezed, pared, pruned, drew back, peeped through; so that without knowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable, and caused this pressure on the top of the head which might well be imputed to the professional conversation, or the fatigue of a great doctor whose life, Lady Bradshaw said, is not his own but his patients' disagreeable it was:"
"so that guests, when the clock struck ten, breathed in the air of Harley Street even with rapture; which relief, however, was denied to his patients."
"There in the grey room, with the pictures on the wall, and the valuable furniture, under the ground glass skylight, they learnt the extent of their transgressions; huddled up in arm chairs, they watched him go through, for their benefit, a curious exercise with the arms, which he shot out, brought sharply back to his hip, to prove if the patient was obstinate that Sir William was master of his own actions, which the patient was not."
"There some weakly broke down; sobbed, submitted;"
"others, inspired by Heaven knows what intemperate madness, called Sir William to his face a damnable humbug; questioned, even more impiously, life itself."
Why live?
Sir William replied that life was good.
"Certainly Lady Bradshaw in ostrich feathers hung over the mantelpiece, and as for his income it was quite twelve thousand a year."
"But to us, they protested, life has given no such bounty."
He acquiesced.
They lacked a sense of proportion.
"And perhaps, after all, there is no God?"
He shrugged his shoulders.
"In short, this living or not living is an affair of our own?"
But there they were mistaken.
"Sir William had a friend in Surrey where they taught, what Sir William frankly admitted was a difficult art"
a sense of proportion.
"There were, moreover, family affection; honour; courage; and a brilliant career."
All of these had in Sir William a resolute champion.
"If they failed him,"
"he had to support police and the good of society, which, he remarked very quietly, would take care, down in Surrey, that these unsocial impulses, bred more than anything by the lack of good blood, were held in control."
"And then stole out from her hiding place and mounted her throne that Goddess whose lust is to override opposition, to stamp indelibly in the sanctuaries of others the image of herself."
"Naked, defenceless, the exhausted, the friendless received the impress of Sir William's will."
He swooped;
he devoured.
He shut people up.
It was this combination of decision and humanity that endeared Sir William so greatly to the relations of his victims.
"But Rezia Warren Smith cried, walking down Harley Street, that she did not like that man."
"Shredding and slicing, dividing and subdividing, the clocks of Harley Street nibbled at the June day, counselled submission, upheld authority, and pointed out in chorus the supreme advantages of a sense of proportion, until the mound of time was so far diminished that a commercial clock, suspended above a shop in Oxford Street, announced, genially and fraternally, as if it were a pleasure to Messrs."
"Rigby and Lowndes to give the information gratis, that it was half past one."
"Looking up, it appeared that each letter of their names stood for one of the hours;"
subconsciously one was grateful to Rigby and Lowndes for giving one time ratified by Greenwich;
"this gratitude so Hugh Whitbread ruminated, dallying there in front of the shop window , naturally took the form later of buying off Rigby and Lowndes socks or shoes."
So he ruminated.
It was his habit.
He did not go deeply.
"He brushed surfaces; the dead languages, the living, life in Constantinople, Paris, Rome; riding, shooting, tennis, it had been once."
"The malicious asserted that he now kept guard at Buckingham Palace, dressed in silk stockings and knee breeches, over what nobody knew."
But he did it extremely efficiently.
He had been afloat on the cream of English society for fifty five years.
He had known Prime Ministers.
His affections were understood to be deep.
"if it were true that he had not taken part in any of the great movements of the time or held important office, one or two humble reforms stood to his credit;"
an improvement in public shelters was one;
the protection of owls in Norfolk another;
servant girls had reason to be grateful to him;
"his name at the end of letters to the Times, asking for funds, appealing to the public to protect, to preserve, to clear up litter, to abate smoke, and stamp out immorality in parks, commanded respect."
"A magnificent figure he cut too, pausing for a moment"
"as the sound of the half hour died away to look critically, magisterially, at socks and shoes; impeccable, substantial, as if he beheld the world from a certain eminence, and dressed to match;"
"but realised the obligations which size, wealth, health, entail, and observed punctiliously even when not absolutely necessary, little courtesies, old fashioned ceremonies which gave a quality to his manner, something to imitate, something to remember him by,"
"for he would never lunch, for example, with Lady Bruton, whom he had known these twenty years, without bringing her in his outstretched hand a bunch of carnations and asking Miss Brush, Lady Bruton's secretary, after her brother in South Africa, which, for some reason, Miss Brush, deficient though she was in every attribute of female charm, so much resented that she said"
"Thank you, he's doing very well in South Africa,"
"Lady Bruton herself preferred Richard Dalloway, who arrived at the next moment."
Indeed they met on the doorstep.
Lady Bruton preferred Richard Dalloway of course.
He was made of much finer material.
But she wouldn't let them run down her poor dear Hugh.
She could never forget his kindness
he had been really remarkably kind
she forgot precisely upon what occasion.
But he had been remarkably kind.
"Anyhow, the difference between one man and another does not amount to much."
"She had never seen the sense of cutting people up, as Clarissa Dalloway did"
cutting them up and sticking them together again; not at any rate when one was sixty two.
She took Hugh's carnations with her angular grim smile.
"There was nobody else coming, she said."
"She had got them there on false pretences, to help her out of a difficulty"
"But let us eat first, she said."
"so there began a soundless and exquisite passing to and fro through swing doors of aproned white capped maids, handmaidens not of necessity, but adepts in a mystery or grand deception practised by hostesses in Mayfair from one thirty to two, when, with a wave of the hand, the traffic ceases, and there rises instead this profound illusion"
in the first place about the food how it is not paid for;
"then that the table spreads itself voluntarily with glass and silver, little mats, saucers of red fruit; films of brown cream mask turbot; in casseroles severed chickens swim; coloured, undomestic, the fire burns; and with the wine and the coffee not paid for rise jocund visions before musing eyes; gently speculative eyes;"
"eyes to whom life appears musical, mysterious; eyes now kindled to observe genially the beauty of the red carnations which Lady Bruton whose movements were always angular had laid beside her plate,"
"so that Hugh Whitbread, feeling at peace with the entire universe and at the same time completely sure of his standing, said, resting his fork,"
Wouldn't they look charming against your lace?
Miss Brush resented this familiarity intensely.
She thought him an underbred fellow.
She made Lady Bruton laugh.
"Lady Bruton raised the carnations,"
holding them rather stiffly with much the same attitude with which the General held the scroll in the picture behind her;
"Which was she now, the General's great grand daughter?"
great great grand daughter?
"Sir Roderick, Sir Miles, Sir Talbot that was it."
It was remarkable how in that family the likeness persisted in the women.
She should have been a general of dragoons herself.
"And Richard would have served under her, cheerfully;"
he had the greatest respect for her;
"he cherished these romantic views about well set up old women of pedigree, and would have liked, in his good humoured way, to bring some young hot heads of his acquaintance to lunch with her;"
as if a type like hers could be bred of amiable tea drinking enthusiasts!
He knew her country.
He knew her people.
"There was a vine, still bearing, which either Lovelace or Herrick she never read a word poetry of herself, but so the story ran had sat under."
"Better wait to put before them the question that bothered her about making an appeal to the public; if so, in what terms and so on ,"
"better wait until they have had their coffee, Lady Bruton thought; and so laid the carnations down beside her plate."
How's Clarissa?
she asked abruptly.
Clarissa always said that Lady Bruton did not like her.
"Indeed, Lady Bruton had the reputation of being more interested in politics than people;"
"of talking like a man; of having had a finger in some notorious intrigue of the eighties, which was now beginning to be mentioned in memoirs."
"Certainly there was an alcove in her drawing room, and a table in that alcove, and a photograph upon that table of General Sir Talbot Moore, now deceased, who had written there one evening in the eighties in Lady Bruton's presence, with her cognisance, perhaps advice, a telegram ordering the British troops to advance upon an historical occasion."
"She kept the pen and told the story. Thus, when she said in her offhand way How's Clarissa?"
"husbands had difficulty in persuading their wives and indeed, however devoted, were secretly doubtful themselves, of her interest in women who often got in their husbands' way, prevented them from accepting posts abroad, and had to be taken to the seaside in the middle of the session to recover from influenza."
"Nevertheless her inquiry, How's Clarissa? was known by women infallibly, to be a signal from a well wisher, from an almost silent companion, whose utterances half a dozen perhaps in the course of a lifetime signified recognition of some feminine comradeship which went beneath masculine lunch parties and united Lady Bruton and Mrs. Dalloway, who seldom met, and appeared when they did meet indifferent and even hostile, in a singular bond."
"I met Clarissa in the Park this morning, said Hugh Whitbread, diving into the casserole, anxious to pay himself this little tribute, for he had only to come to London and he met everybody at once; but greedy, one of the greediest men she had ever known, Milly Brush thought, who observed men with unflinching rectitude, and was capable of everlasting devotion, to her own sex in particular, being knobbed, scraped, angular, and entirely without feminine charm."
D'you know who's in town?
said Lady Bruton suddenly bethinking her.
"Our old friend, Peter Walsh."
They all smiled.
Peter Walsh!
"And Mr. Dalloway was genuinely glad, Milly Brush thought; and Mr. Whitbread thought only of his chicken."
"All three, Lady Bruton, Hugh Whitbread, and Richard Dalloway, remembered the same thing"
how passionately Peter had been in love; been rejected; gone to India; come a cropper; made a mess of things;
Richard Dalloway had a very great liking for the dear old fellow too.
"Milly Brush saw that; saw a depth in the brown of his eyes; saw him hesitate; consider; which interested her, as Mr. Dalloway always interested her, for what was he thinking, she wondered, about Peter Walsh?"
"That Peter Walsh had been in love with Clarissa; that he would go back directly after lunch and find Clarissa; that he would tell her, in so many words, that he loved her."
"Yes, he would say that."
Milly Brush once might almost have fallen in love with these silences; and Mr. Dalloway was always so dependable; such a gentleman too.
"Now, being forty, Lady Bruton had only to nod, or turn her head a little abruptly,"
"Milly Brush took the signal, however deeply she might be sunk in these reflections of a detached spirit, of an uncorrupted soul whom life could not bamboozle, because life had not offered her a trinket of the slightest value; not a curl, smile, lip, cheek, nose; nothing whatever; Lady Bruton had only to nod, and Perkins was instructed to quicken the coffee."
"Yes; Peter Walsh has come back, said Lady Bruton."
It was vaguely flattering to them all.
"He had come back, battered, unsuccessful, to their secure shores."
"But to help him, they reflected, was impossible;"
there was some flaw in his character.
Hugh Whitbread said one might of course mention his name to So and so.
"He wrinkled lugubriously, consequentially, at the thought of the letters he would write to the heads of Government offices about my old friend, Peter Walsh, and so on."
"But it wouldn't lead to anything not to anything permanent, because of his character."
"In trouble with some woman, said Lady Bruton."
They had all guessed that THAT was at the bottom of it.
"However, we shall hear the whole story from Peter himself."
The coffee was very slow in coming.
The address?
murmured Hugh Whitbread;
They were waiting to bring the coffee until Mr. Whitbread had finished.
"Hugh was very slow, Lady Bruton thought."
"He was getting fat, she noticed."
Richard always kept himself in the pink of condition.
She was getting impatient;
"the whole of her being was setting positively, undeniably, domineeringly brushing aside all this unnecessary trifling Peter Walsh and his affairs upon that subject which engaged her attention, and not merely her attention,"
"but that fibre which was the ramrod of her soul, that essential part of her without which Millicent Bruton would not have been Millicent Bruton;"
that project for emigrating young people of both sexes born of respectable parents and setting them up with a fair prospect of doing well in Canada.
She exaggerated.
She had perhaps lost her sense of proportion.
"Emigration was not to others the obvious remedy, the sublime conception."
"It was not to them not to Hugh, or Richard, or even to devoted Miss Brush the liberator of the pent egotism,"
"a strong martial woman, well nourished, well descended, of direct impulses, downright feelings, and little introspective power broad and simple"
why could not every one be broad and simple?
"youth is past, and must eject upon some object"
"it may be Emigration, it may be Emancipation; but whatever it be, this object round which the essence of her soul is daily secreted, becomes inevitably prismatic, lustrous, half looking glass, half precious stone; now carefully hidden in case people should sneer at it; now proudly displayed."
"Emigration had become, in short, largely Lady Bruton."
But she had to write.
"And one letter to the Times, she used to say to Miss Brush, cost her more than to organise an expedition to South Africa which she had done in the war ."
"After a morning's battle beginning, tearing up, beginning again, she used to feel the futility of her own womanhood as she felt it on no other occasion, and would turn gratefully to the thought of Hugh Whitbread who possessed no one could doubt it"
the art of writing letters to the Times.
"A being so differently constituted from herself, with such a command of language; able to put things as editors like them put; had passions which one could not call simply greed."
"Lady Bruton often suspended judgement upon men in deference to the mysterious accord in which they, but no woman, stood to the laws of the universe; knew how to put things; knew what was said;"
"so that if Richard advised her, and Hugh wrote for her, she was sure of being somehow right."
"So she let Hugh eat his souffle; asked after poor Evelyn; waited until they were smoking, and then said,"
"Milly, would you fetch the papers?"
"And Miss Brush went out, came back;"
laid papers on the table; and Hugh produced his fountain pen;
"his silver fountain pen, which had done twenty years' service, he said, unscrewing the cap."
It was still in perfect order;
he had shown it to the makers;
"there was no reason, they said,"
"why it should ever wear out; which was somehow to Hugh's credit, and to the credit of the sentiments which his pen expressed so Richard Dalloway felt as Hugh began carefully writing capital letters with rings round them in the margin, and thus marvellously reduced Lady Bruton's tangles to sense, to grammar such as the editor of the Times, Lady Bruton felt, watching the marvellous transformation, must respect."
Hugh was slow.
Hugh was pertinacious.
Richard said one must take risks.
"Hugh proposed modifications in deference to people's feelings, which, he said rather tartly when Richard laughed, had to be considered, and read out how, therefore, we are of opinion that the times are ripe..."
"which Richard thought all stuffing and bunkum,"
"but no harm in it,"
"of course, and Hugh went on drafting sentiments in alphabetical order of the highest nobility, brushing the cigar ash from his waistcoat, and summing up now and then the progress they had made until, finally, he read out the draft of a letter which Lady Bruton felt certain was a masterpiece."
Could her own meaning sound like that?
Hugh could not guarantee that the editor would put it in; but he would be meeting somebody at luncheon.
"Whereupon Lady Bruton, who seldom did a graceful thing, stuffed all Hugh's carnations into the front of her dress, and flinging her hands out called him"
What she would have done without them both she did not know.
They rose.
"And Richard Dalloway strolled off as usual to have a look at the General's portrait, because he meant, whenever he had a moment of leisure, to write a history of Lady Bruton's family."
And Millicent Bruton was very proud of her family.
"But they could wait, they could wait, she said, looking at the picture;"
"meaning that her family, of military men, administrators, admirals, had been men of action, who had done their duty;"
"Richard's first duty was to his country, but it was a fine face, she said;"
all the papers were ready for Richard down at Aldmixton whenever the time came; the Labour Government she meant.
