In the heat and sands of India, the flowers and marshes of Africa, the outskirts of London, wherever the climate or the devil tempts human beings to slip from the straight path that is theirs, even at this very moment they are busy lowering the pulpits, breaking the idols, and erecting their own gloomy faces in their place.
His name is Hamkish.
It brings forth the will of the weak, it is in love with influencing, imposing, praising, and its own self-made paradises that have been popularized among the masses.
In Hyde Park, a preacher stands on a pedestal and delivers a sermon.
Complexity walks in the white uncle, showing repentance with the disguise of brotherly love in factories and legislative assemblies; it offers help, but seeks power.
Opponents or dissatisfied individuals are violently pushed aside; he bestows his good wishes upon those who, with their heads held high, obediently avert their eyes from his gaze.
This lady, Rosalind Warren Smith, found her way into the heart of William Jaidashat, although she was hidden, as often happens, in the disguise of a humble and selfless love duty.
Ready to do whatever it takes.
What efforts it takes to secure financial resources and establish institutions to promote terminology.
But the goddess of strictness loves the circulation of blood more than bricks, and she presents the will of humans on her table in the most delicate way.
Her example is Lady Bird.
Fifteen years had passed.
It was not something that could be precisely pinpointed, neither controversial nor tumultuous, just surrendering to the will of Sir William's determination.
Her smile was sweet, and her criticism quickly turned into a dinner invitation on Harley Street, feeding eight to nine stages of nourishment to ten to fifteen guests from various soft and delicate specialties.
But the passage of the night had left a very brief or perhaps painful sense of nervousness, a scattered and confused residue, which made believing in it truly heartbreaking.
The poor lady was telling lies.
Once upon a time, long ago, he used to go freely and unrestrainedly to hunt for salmon.
Her husband's eyes were shining with a greedy light as she prepared herself to satisfy his thirst for power. The pressure on her increased, she was compressed, diminished, pruned, and she sat back, pulling her headscarf in a way that made it clear what had made that night abnormal. The weight on her shoulders had become so heavy that it could probably be attributed to professional conversations or the exhaustion of a great passion, which, as Lady Bridget said, is not her own life but that of her patients. It was becoming an abnormal night.
Guests would exclaim with indescribable excitement when the clock struck ten, as the atmosphere of Harley Street would carry them away with a soothing sensation, which, of course, deprived its patients of such relief.
There, in the gray room with paintings on the walls and expensive furniture, under the opaque glass skylight, they watched him sitting in comfortable chairs, making strange movements with his hands to see if he was a stubborn patient or not, quickly stretching them out on both sides of the rails to prove that Sir William is in control of his affairs and not a patient.
This was where weak people would break down, cry, and surrender.
Others, inspired by God, knew which excessive madness they called William, the cursed fanatic, with even more arrogance in his own life, how and why they did it.
Why should they stay alive at all?
Sir William replied that it is his own life.
Of course, Lady Bardshaw was hanging ostrich feathers over her stove, and she, who had an income of twelve thousand a year, was protesting.
But life has not bestowed such blessings upon us.
It was accepted.
They had an understanding of the proportionality of things.
Maybe, despite all these words, there is no God involved at all.
He shrugged.
Unless it is about living or not living, it does not concern ourselves.
But they were mistaken about this one.
William admired a friend in Sari who taught him something that William honestly admitted was a difficult art.
Understanding the proportion of things.
In addition, they had love for each other; nobility; bravery; and a brilliant profession.
All of these were firmly established in Sir William's mind.
If they don't have any work to do.
He had to call on the police and the good and righteous members of society to support him, which showed that they would take care of the situation in Sari, where these anti-social movements, which are mainly caused by the lack of good principles and values, will be restrained.
And then the goddess, who opposed being overwhelmed by desire, would break the unbreakable seal of her own image in the privacy of others, and sit on her throne.
The naked and defenseless embraced the will of Sir William, supporting the fallen and the helpless.
The attQack was launched.
He was swallowing.
People were suffocating.
It was this combination of determination and humanity that made Sir William so dear to the eyes of his relatives' victims.
Emaratzia Warren Smith was shouting on Harley Street that she didn't like that man.
Hours passed on Harley Street, dividing and dividing again the day of June. They recommended obedience, affirmed authority, and together demonstrated the great benefits of understanding the perfect proportion until the mass of time dwindled so much that a clock hung over a shop on Oxford Street kindly and fraternally announced that it was one-thirty.
It seems that Mr. Rugby and Mr. Lundy would be pleased with the free provision of this information.
When you looked up, it seemed that each letter of their name was taking the place of a number on the clock.
The subconscious was grateful to Rugby and Lundiz for informing one that it had reached the approval of Greenwich.
This idea was in Hugh Whitbread's mind, who was busy contemplating in front of the shop window, and of course afterwards he would go on to buy socks or shoes from Rugby and Lundys.
His reflections were like this.
He was used to it.
It didn't go deep.
On the surface, it seems that life in Constantinople, Paris, and Rome is full of dead and alive languages, shooting, horseback riding, tennis, and such.
The enemies claimed that now the palace is wearing silk stockings with Buckingham, or it is unclear what the stocking garter is doing.
But he/she was doing this task perfectly.
Fifty-five years ago, the highest layer of society in England was immersed.
The prime ministers had seen.
They said that his emotions are deep.
If it is true that he did not participate in any of the major movements of his time or was not significant in any important position, he can take pride in a few minor reforms.
One of them was improving public shelters.
Protecting the puffins of Norfok.
Another one of the maids owed her a debt.
His name was at the bottom of his letters to The Times, in which he asked for financial assistance, urging people to protect the environment by reducing waste, avoiding smoke, and eliminating immoral behavior in parks, which inspired respect.
It had a magnificent appearance when it paused for a moment.
When the bell rang, it was almost impossible for her to look critically and disrespectfully at the socks and shoes, as if she was looking at the world from a high position, and at the same time she was wearing the clothes of authority.
But he understood the commitments that come with the amount of wealth and health he pursued, and he meticulously observed even the outdated formalities when it was not absolutely necessary, which added a quality to his character that deserved imitation, something that would be remembered of him.
Because it was never possible, for example, for Lady Brutton, who was twenty years old, to have lunch without a servant bringing her a silver tray and asking Miss Brutton's secretary about her brother's condition in South Africa, even though she was not interested in any aspect of his attractiveness.
Thank you, his situation is good in South Africa.
Lady Bracknell preferred to have Mr. Delvoy arrive at that very moment.
They actually saw each other at the door.
Lady Bracknell, of course, preferred Richard Dalloway.
The weather was much better.
But he was not willing to belittle his beloved little child, Hui.
He couldn't forget her love.
It was really very kind of him/her.
He didn't exactly remember what the case was about.
But he had been very kind in the end.
In any case, the difference between one man and another is not that great.
He had never understood that nonsense should put people under the criticism knife, something that Clarissa always did.
They take them under the knife and stick them back together, a sixty-two-year-old man, forever.
He captured Hugh's laughter with his sullen and affected smile.
He said that no one else is coming.
He used their excuses as a pretext to help them solve a problem.
But first, let's eat.
In this way, the silent and skillful users of the closed apron and white hat began to move back and forth through the double doors, not that they were necessarily the tired servants of a formal ceremony or a deceptive grandeur that the hostesses would put on from one-thirty to two o'clock, when the flow came to a halt with a wave of the hand and instead a deep illusion crept in.
First of all, about food, it should not be paid for.
Furthermore, the table extends itself with glass jars and silverware under small plates, filled with red fruits, fish scales, cream-covered coffee leaves, and shredded chicken in floating dishes. Non-domestic colored fires burn, and unpaid images of joy are captured in front of thoughtful eyes with wine and coffee.
Soft eyes exploring the eyes that envision life as music, mysterious eyes that sparkle with electricity and witness the beauty of blushing cheeks, which Lady BrontÃ«, whose movements were always dry, had placed next to her plate.
As Hugh Whitbread, who was completely confident in his position while the whole world was in chaos, put down his fork, he asked: "?"
If they are next to your towers, they won't have any special effect.
The girl was tired of being herself and wanted to become someone else.
He seemed to be a man without origin or lineage.
Her words made Lady Burton laugh.
Lady BrontÃ« picked up the seashells.
They were amazed and fascinated as the general grabbed the dice in the same order as he had seen on the board behind him.
Richard Deloy asked himself, "By the way, what was the outcome, General?"
What's the plan, General?
His head was in a mile-long tall boot.
It was strange that there was a resemblance among women in this family.
Lady Bracknell herself should have been a general in the Swiss army.
And Richard also served him willingly and obediently.
He found it difficult to respect him.
He had romantic thoughts about the old woman with noble lineage and a good figure, and he didn't mind bringing some of his fiery young acquaintances with him to her lunch party, along with his special charm.
It is as if a character like him could be nurtured from a cheerful and tea-loving heart.
He recognized her heart and her land.
People knew him.
How long was it until it was revealed that Lewis or Harry himself never read poetry, but it was heard that he had been sitting under it.
It is better for him to wait before discussing the matter that has been bothering him with them, about seeking help from others, and if he does so, how and from these words.
Lady Porten said in the middle of the conversation that it is better to wait until they finish their coffee, so she put the jokes aside next to her plate.
How is Clarissa?
Suddenly he asked.
Larisa always said that Lady Burton doesn't like her.
In fact, it was also evident that Lady Beecham is more interested in politics.
He talks to people like dead men, his foot is in a disgraceful conspiracy in the decade of the 90s, which was only gradually revealed in the written memories of others.
Undoubtedly, the king was sitting in his reception room, with a table in front of him and a picture of General Talbot Moore on the table, who had already passed away. It was in the evening of a decade ago when, in the presence of Lady Bruton, he might have written a telegram, perhaps at her recommendation, and issued the order for the advance of the British troops in a historic incident.
He still held the pen and it was difficult for husbands to know how Clarissa was: he described the story.
For this reason, when he mentioned his complicated method, they would persuade their spouses and, in fact, no matter how much doubt they had in their hearts that he had an interest in women who often took advantage of their husbands, they would prevent them from accepting foreign guests and they had to take them to Clarissa in the middle of the parliamentary session by the sea to treat their influenza.
However, women knew that his question, "How are you?" was a sign of a friendly companion who was almost silent, and his words might have been said ten or twelve times throughout a lifetime, telling the story of a feminine camaraderie that took place under male lunch parties, uniting Lady Brutton and Mrs. Delvey, who rarely saw each other, and when they did, they appeared indifferent and even hostile.
Hugh Whitbread, the womanizer, was restless about his small token of appreciation for himself. He just had to come to London and see everyone together, but his desire for Rashid, the greedy man he had ever known, spoke frankly in the heart. This morning, I saw Clarissa in the park, saying that he was finally observing men under his supervision and not scratching the knot that was completely useless from any feminine charm. He had the capacity for eternal guardianship, especially for his fellow men.
Do you know who is in the city?
Suddenly, Lady Brutton thought carefully and said.
Our old friend Peter Walsh.
Everyone smiled.
Peter Walsh!
Mili expressed her love for Rash and said that Mr. Delawi is also very happy from the bottom of his heart, and Mr. Whitbread is only thinking about his chicken.
All three ladies, BrontÃ«, Hewitt, and Deloitte, reminded me of one thing.
Peter, who was in love with a girl, had his request rejected, went to India, was heartbroken, and ruined everything.
Richard loved his dear old friend so much.
He saw a depth in her coffee-colored eyes, pondered, and realized that Barish was interesting, so much so that Mr. Delvoy always wondered what he thought about Peter Walsh.
It is that Peter Walsh has loved Clarissa, it is that immediately after lunch he goes and finds Clarissa, it is that Sally and her cracked skin tell him that she loves him.
Yes, that's exactly what he was saying.
There was nothing left when Milli fell in love with these silences and Mr. Delavi was always very reliable, and so was Mr. Aghamansh.
Now, at the age of forty, it was enough for Lady Burton to shake her head or turn it slightly quickly.
No matter how deeply Millie immersed herself in these spiritual contemplations, her soul remained intact, as life had not been able to deceive her with its fleeting pleasures, which had no value whatsoever. She had not been given any sign, not a single strand of hair, not a smile on her lips, not a wrinkle on her nose, nothing at all. It was enough for Lady Brutton to move her head slightly for her to tell Perkins to bring the coffee sooner.
Yes, Peter Walsh has returned, Lady Burton said he had come back.
Pride satisfied everyone, whether they understood it or not.
They were broken and unsuccessful, seeking safe shores.
It is impossible for them to help him.
There is a flaw in his character.
Hugh Whitbread said that, of course, it is possible for my old friend to place his order with that person.
The self-centered melancholy of thinking about the letters that should have been written to the heads of government departments and the way these words were twisted.
But he didn't get anywhere, he remained stagnant because of his personality.
Porten said that he has gotten into trouble with a woman.
Everyone guessed and assumed that this must be the case in the end.
In any case, you will hear the whole story from Peter himself.
Bringing the coffee took a long time.
The address
Hugh Whitbread muttered under his breath.
I'm waiting for Mr. Whitbread to finish his work so that they bring the coffee.
Lady Bracknell is in the heart of the conversation, Hugh.
He realized that he was getting fat.
Richard always saw himself as a failure.
He was getting tired anymore.
His whole being seemed to be under the firm control of an overwhelming dominance, disregarding all the unnecessary details of Peter Walsh and his relationships, which had preoccupied him.
Not only did he pay attention to that field, but also to the branch of knowledge that had become the essence of his soul, the vital part of him without which Millicent Burton would not be Millicent Burton.
The same project involves migrating young people from both genders from respectable parental backgrounds and establishing them with suitable opportunities for progress in Canada.
He was exaggerating.
Perhaps he had lost his understanding of the proportion of things.
Migration was not an obvious solution or a brilliant new idea for others.
In their opinion, whether it was Hugh, Richard, or even Miss Rash, the self-centeredness was not a barrier to their liberation.
A strong and determined woman with proper upbringing, Lady Bruton asked for the clear and straightforward expression of emotions, decisiveness, inner power, and a little bit of simplicity and clarity for the sake of goodness.
Why can't everyone be straightforward and simple?
His youth has passed, and he feels a surge within him.
He must find joy, whether it be through migration or voluntary movements, but whatever it is, this thing that the essence of his soul exudes every day, becomes a transparent, precious, half-mirror, half-stone object, sometimes carefully hidden so that people do not mock it, and sometimes proudly displayed.
In summary, migration was mainly initiated by Lady Burton herself.
But he had to write.
And writing a letter to The Times, as he usually referred to Miss Rosh, about organizing the deployment of forces to South Africa, which had incurred significant costs during the war.
After a morning of struggling, she felt the futility of being a woman so strongly that she never felt in any other situation, and she rightfully turned her thoughts to Hugh Whitbread, whom no one could doubt.
The owner of the art of writing was a contributor to the Times.
The nature of his cargo inventory was so different from him, with such control over language, that he was able to present the problem in a way that the editors liked, with desires that he couldn't free himself from and called it the name of lust.
Lady Bracknell often delayed making judgments about men out of respect for their mysterious ways and the laws of the world, but no woman was ever so well aware of how to speak her mind.
What they say is that if Richard followed his guidance and Hugh wrote for him, he would be sure that he is right in some way.
That's why he let Hugh smoke his cigarette, now the little child asked the first question, hesitated until they lit their cigarettes and then said: ?
You should bring the papers.
The young lady went out and came back to Rash.
He put the papers on the table and took out his notebook.
His silver pen, which he said had served him for twenty years, opened the door for him.
It is still correct and intact.
It had shown it to its creators.
They said there is no reason.
Never worn out, Hugh's pride was, and as he began to write the capital letters carefully with loops around them, Richard Deloy felt the pride of emotions expressed by his pen diminish to the most subtle of Lady Brouton's sarcasms to understand his intention, he reduced the command of language so that Lady Brouton felt this extraordinary transformation she was witnessing, the editor of Time magazine would surely respect it.
He was kind.
He was persistent.
Richard said that he had to take a risk.
Hugh suggested some adjustments to consider people's emotions, so when Richard laughed, it was almost like, "So how do we believe the right time has come..."
According to Richard, it seemed like nonsense and gibberish.
But of course, there was no harm done...
The religion we have for the dead and Hugh, in our opinion, continued the highest and greatest of their noble feelings in alphabetical order, shaking the cigarette ash from his collar and occasionally summarizing the progress he had made until finally reading a draft of a letter that Lady Bronton had no doubt was a masterpiece.
Does that mean his intention could have been expressed like this?
Hugh couldn't guarantee that the editor would publish this letter, but he was supposed to see someone at the lunch reception.
It was here that Lady Brutton, who rarely showed any grace, swept all the laughter of the crowd under her dress and raised her hands in the air.
He didn't know what he could do if they weren't there.
They stood up.
Richard Deloy, as usual, casually went to take a look at the portrait of General because he intended to write the history of the Lady Bruton family whenever he had a little free time.
Millicent Burton struggled with her family.
It is said that he put aside the painting he was looking at for later.
His intention was that his family members were military men, administrators, and seafarers who were men of action and fulfilled their duties.
Richard's first duty towards his country, he said, is to be a beautiful face and whenever his time comes.
All the documents for Richard are ready in Aldermaston, meaning the Labour Party government.
