In the heat and sands of India, the flowers and marshes of Africa, the outskirts of London, wherever the climate or the devil tempts human beings to slip from the straight path that is theirs, even at this very moment they are busy lowering the pulpits, breaking the idols, and erecting their own gloomy faces in their place.
His name is Hamkish Gardani.
It is derived from the weak will of its own wall, it is in love with influencing, imposing, praising and its own heavens that have been popularized as the people's love.
In Hyde Park, a preacher stands on a pedestal and delivers a sermon.
The complex twists in Uncle White's path, adorned with the garment of brotherly love, lead him through factories and legislative assemblies; he offers assistance, but seeks power.
Opponents or dissatisfied people are pushed aside with violence; he offers his good wishes to those who raise their heads and obediently take their eyes off his eyes.
This lady, Beatriz Warren Smith, found her way into the heart of William Jardashat, although she was hidden in such a way that she often appeared in disguise, a mysterious figure of selflessness and unrequited love.
Ready to do whatever it takes.
What efforts it takes to secure financial resources and establish institutions to promote terminologies.
But the goddess of strictness, Hemkish, loves bloodshed more than bricks and invites the most delicate human will to her bloody feast.
The example is Lady Birdshaw.
Fifteen years had passed.
It was not something that could be precisely pinpointed, neither controversial nor tumultuous, just surrendering to his will, immersed in the will of Sir William.
Her smile was sweet, and her transformation happened quickly. She had dinner on Harley Street, feeding eight to nine stages of nourishment to fifteen important guests from various fields, all soft and delicate.
But the passage of the night had left a very brief or perhaps painful sense of nervousness, a scattered and confused residue, which made it really painful to believe in something.
The poor lady was telling lies.
Once upon a time, long ago, free and unrestrained, he used to go fishing for rainbow trout.
The tense and anxious atmosphere was ready to serve the thirst for power that was igniting her husband's eyes with a gleam. It gathered, compressed, diminished, pruned, and settled back, pulling the reins so tightly that it was not clear exactly what had made that night abnormal and caused all this pressure to weigh heavily on her. It was likely that it could be attributed to professional conversations or the exhaustion of a great interest that her life, as Lady Bridshaw put it, was not her own, but belonged to her patients. It was becoming an abnormal night.
Guests would exclaim with indescribable excitement when the clock struck ten, taking in the extraordinary atmosphere of Harley Street, a comfort that, unfortunately, was deprived of its patients.
There, in the gray room with paintings on the walls and expensive furniture, under the dim light of frosted glass, they watched him sitting in comfortable chairs, making strange movements with his hands to see if he was still in control of himself and not sick, quickly stretching them out on both sides of the bed to prove that Sir William was in charge and not ill.
This was where weak people would break down, cry, and surrender.
The rest, inspired by God, knew which excessive madness they called William, the cursed fanatic, with even more arrogance in his own life, why and how they did it.
Why should they stay alive at all?
Sir William replied that his life was his own.
Of course, Lady Bardshaw was hanging her ostrich feathers over the stove, and she, who had an income of twelve thousand a year, was protesting.
But life has not bestowed such blessings upon us.
Accepted
They understood the coherence of affairs from being in harmony.
Maybe, after all, none of these words matter at all, and there is no God involved in this?
He shrugged.
Except that whether to live or not to live is up to ourselves, in short.
But they were making a mistake.
Sir William had a friend in Sari who taught him something that Sir William honestly admitted is a difficult art.
Understanding the proportion of affairs,
In addition, they had kindness; nobility; bravery; and a brilliant profession.
All of these have been steadfastly present in Sir William's leadership.
If they don't mind
The police and the benefactors of society had to call for their support, which showed great tranquility, that they would take care of Sari, so that these anti-social shocks, which are mainly caused by the lack of good principles and morals, would be restrained.
And then the divine lady, who opposed being captivated by desire, would break the unbreakable seal and step out of her hidden place, sitting on her throne.
The naked and defenseless embraced the will of Sir William, who cared for the fallen and the helpless.
The attack was underway.
He was swallowing.
He was suffocating people.
It was this combination of determination and humanity that made William so dear in the eyes of his relatives' victims.
Emaratzia Warren Smith was walking down Harley Street shouting that she didn't like that man.
Hours passed on Harley Street, dividing and subdividing the June day with a kind of superlative minuteness, and the clocks, as if to emphasise their evil intent, struck each quarter with a sound which was calculated, not to urge mankind to greater effort, but to inflict upon his soul the penalty of being late, and then, having done their worst, broke into a melody of chimes, which proclaimed the flight of time to the world in general, and to Mr. Reginald Cuff in particular, with such a sweetness and variety of expression, that it was impossible to resist the conviction that they were not only the most musical, but also the most intelligent, of all the clocks that ever were made.
It seems that Mr. Rugby and Lundy are pleased with the free provision of this information.
When you looked up, it seemed that each letter of their name represented a digit of the clock.
The subconscious was grateful to Rugby and Lundiz for informing the person that it had reached the approval of Greenwich.
This idea was in Hugh's mind while he was engrossed in contemplating the shop window, and of course, afterwards it would manifest as buying rugby socks or shoes from Rigby and Lundis.
His reflections were like this.
It was his habit.
It didn't go deep.
It is rare to find such a dead language alive in Constantinople, Paris, Rome, horseback riding, shooting, tennis, and at times like this.
The enemies claimed that now the palace is wearing silk stockings with Buckingham Palace, or maybe the stocking garter is doing something unknown.
But he was doing this job perfectly.
Fifty-five years ago, the highest layer of British society was immersed.
The prime ministers had seen.
They said that his emotions are deep.
If it is true that he did not participate in any of the major movements of his time or was not significant in any important position, he can take pride in a few minor reforms.
One of them was improving public shelters.
Protecting the puffins.
Another one of the maids owed her a debt.
His name was at the bottom of his letters to The Times, in which he asked for financial assistance, urging people to protect the environment by reducing waste, eliminating smoke, and eradicating immoral acts in parks, which inspired respect.
It had a magnificent appearance when it paused for a moment.
Then, when the bell rang, it was almost impossible for her to look critically and disdainfully at the socks and shoes, as if she was looking at the world from a high position, and at the same time she was putting on her clothes.
But he understood the responsibilities that come with wealth and health, and he meticulously observed even the outdated formalities that added a certain quality to his character, something worthy of imitation, something that people would remember him for.
Because it was never possible, for example, for Miss Broughton, who was twenty years old, to have lunch without a maid bringing her a tray with a napkin in her outstretched hand and asking Lady Broughton's secretary about her brother in South Africa, even though the secretary, despite her attractiveness, was not interested in him in any way.
Thank you, his situation is good in South Africa.
Lady Bracknell preferred to have her daughter Gwendolen arrive at that very moment.
In fact, they saw each other at the door.
Lady Bracknell, of course, preferred Richard Dalloway.
The weather was much better.
But he was not willing to belittle his beloved child.
He couldn't forget her love.
It was really very kind of him.
He didn't exactly remember what the case was.
But he had been very kind.
However, the difference between one man and another is not that great.
She had never understood why gossip had to criticize people, something that Clarissa always did.
They took them under the knife and stuck them back together, a sixty-two-year-old man, forever.
He captured Hugh's laughter with his forced and pretentious smile.
It was said that no one else is coming.
He used their excuses as a pretext to help him solve a problem.
But first, let's eat.
In this way, the silent and skillful users of the white apron and hat began to move back and forth through the double doors, not that they were the tired servants of a ceremonial series or a deceptive grandeur that the hostesses would bring in from one and a half to two o'clock, when the flow came to a halt with a wave of the hand and instead a deep illusion crept in.
First of all, about food, it shouldn't be paid for.
Furthermore, the table extends itself with glass jars and silverware under small plates filled with red fruits, fish scales under cream-colored whipped cream, shredded chicken in dishes floating in non-domestic colored fire, and with unpaid money for wine and coffee, joyful images are captured in front of thoughtful eyes.
Soft eyes exploring eyes that consider life as music, mysterious eyes that sparkle with electricity and witness the beauty of red lips that Lady Burton, whose movements were always dry, had placed next to her plate.
As Hugh Whitbread, who was perfectly sure of his position in the world, put his knife down, he said:
If they are next to you, they won't stand out.
The girl was tired of being herself and wanted to become someone else.
He seemed to be a rootless man.
Her words made Lady Burton laugh.
Lady Brontë picked up the giggles.
Almost immediately, the generals were captivated and fascinated as they grabbed the map in the same order that the general had taken it from behind him.
Richard Deloy asked himself, "By the way, what was the result, General?"
Are you a general?
He had his head in a mile-long scarf.
It was strange that the resemblance continued among the women in this family.
Lady Bracknell herself must have been a general in the saw army.
And Richard also served under his command willingly.
He respected him difficultly.
He had romantic thoughts about the old woman with a noble and well-built lineage and didn't mind bringing some of his fiery young acquaintances with him to her lunch party, along with his special charm.
It seems a character like him could be nurtured from a cheerful and tea-loving heart!
I recognized his heart and his land.
People knew him.
How long was it until it was revealed that Lewis or Harry himself never read poetry, but it was heard that he had been sitting under it.
It is better for him to wait before discussing the matter that has been bothering him with them, about resorting to the public and if he does so, how and from these words.
Lady Porten said in the middle of the conversation that it is better to wait until they finish their coffee and therefore she put the napkins aside.
How is Clarissa?
Suddenly he asked.
Larisa always said that Lady Burton didn't like her.
Actually, Lady Beecham was more inclined towards politics.
He talks to people like dead men, his foot is in a disgraceful conspiracy in the decade that is gradually emerging in the written memories of others.
Undoubtedly, the king was sitting in his reception room, with a table in front of him and a picture of General Talbot Moore on the table, who had passed away. It was evening in the decade when Lady Bruton was present, and perhaps at her recommendation, he had written a telegram and issued the order for the advance of the British troops in a historic incident.
She still held the pen and it was difficult for the husbands to know how Clarissa was: she was telling the story.
For this reason, when they talked to him about his complicated method, they convinced their wives and, in fact, despite their own doubts, they prevented him from having any interest in women who often took advantage of their husbands. They were prevented from accepting drunken people outside the country, and they had to take them to Clarissa in the middle of the parliamentary session by the sea to treat their flu.
However, good women knew that his question, "Will you come back?" was a sign of a friendly companion who was almost silent, whose words might have been said ten or twelve times throughout a lifetime, telling the story of a feminine friendship recognition that took place under masculine lunch parties, and united Lady Britten and Mrs. Delow, who rarely saw each other, and when they did, they appeared indifferent and even hostile, in a unique bond.
Hugh Whitbread, the restless lioness in the chicken feed, was grateful enough to finally come to London and see everyone together, but his desire for Rashid, the greedy man he had ever known, said that he had seen Clarissa in the park this morning. He said that he was finally observing men with decisiveness and not scratching the surface of any feminine charm, with the capacity for eternal guardianship, especially of his own kind.
Do you know who is in the city?
Suddenly, Lady Bruten thought carefully and said.
Our old friend Peter Walsh.
Everyone smiled.
Peter Walsh!
Mili also told Mr. Delawi that she is very happy and Mr. Whitbread is only thinking about his chicken.
All three ladies, Brontë, Hewitt, and Deloitte, remembered one thing.
Peter had been in love with a girl who had rejected him, so he went to India, had a breakdown, and ruined everything.
Richard loved this dear old friend so much.
She saw a reflection in her coffee-colored eyes, she contemplated and realized that Barry was interesting, so interesting that Mr. Deloy always wondered what he thought about Peter Walsh.
It is that Peter Walsh has been in love with Clarissa, that he immediately goes after lunch and finds Clarissa, that Sally and Septimus tell her that they love her.
Yes, that's exactly what he was saying.
There was only one thing left, that Milli would fall in love with these silences and Mr. Delavi was always very reliable, and so was Mr. Aghamansh.
In her forties, Lady Burton didn't need to shake her head vigorously or spin it quickly.
No matter how deeply Millie was immersed in these spiritual contemplations, her soul remained intact, unaffected by the life that had failed to deceive her. Because life had not given her any joy, even the slightest value, neither a curl of hair nor a smile on her lips, nor a nose between her cheeks, nor any sign at all. It was enough for Lady Bruton to move her head slightly to tell Perkins to bring the coffee sooner.
Yes, Peter Walsh has returned, Lady Burton said he had returned.
Understanding or not, pride satisfied them all.
They were stranded on the safe shores in their failed attempt.
They realized that helping him is impossible.
There is a flaw in his character.
Hugh Whitbread said that, of course, my old friend can place his order with that person.
I am saddened by the self-centeredness of the thoughts in the letters that were supposed to be written to the heads of government departments, and the way these words were twisted.
But he didn't get anywhere, he remained stagnant because of his personality.
Porten said that a woman has gotten into trouble.
Everyone guessed and assumed that this must be the case.
In any case, you will hear the whole story from Peter himself.
They took too long to bring the coffee.
Address
Hugh Whitbread muttered under his breath.
Mr. Whitbread waited until he finished his work to bring the coffee.
Lady Bracknell is in the heart of Hugh Kelly.
Realized he was getting fat.
Richard always saw himself as a failure.
He was getting tired anymore.
His whole existence seemed to be under the firm control of an overwhelming dominance, disregarding all unnecessary details of Peter Walsh and his relationships, which had preoccupied him.
Not only did he pay attention to that field, but also to the branch of knowledge that had become his soul, that vital part of him without which Millicent Burton would not be Millicent Burton.
The same project aims to migrate young people from both genders from respectable parental backgrounds and provide them with suitable opportunities for progress in Canada.
He was exaggerating.
Maybe he had lost his understanding of the proportion of things.
Migration was not an obvious solution for others; it was a great innovative idea.
They did not consider whether Hugh, Richard, or even Miss Bingley herself, were capable of freeing themselves from their own vanity.
A strong and determined woman with proper upbringing, seeking goodness, asked Lady Brontë about the impact of explicit emotions, decisive power, and limited introspection.
Why can't everyone be straightforward and simple?
His youth has passed, and he feels a surge inside him.
He must find joy, whether it be through migration or voluntary movements, but whatever it is, this thing that the essence of his soul exudes every day, becomes a transparent, precious, half-mirror, half-stone object, sometimes hidden carefully so that people do not mock it, and sometimes proudly displayed.
In summary, migration was mainly led by Lady Burton.
But he had to write.
And writing a letter to The Times, as he usually referred to Miss Rash, asking her about the organization of sending troops to South Africa, which was arranged during the war and had a high cost.
After a morning of fighting, she felt the futility of being a woman so strongly that she had never felt in any other situation, and she resolutely turned her thoughts to Hugh Whitbread, whom no one could doubt deserved her attention.
The owner of the letter was writing to the Times.
The inventory of cargo had such a different nature from him, with such control over language, that he could not present the problem in a way that the editors liked, with desires that he could not free himself from and called it the name of freedom.
Lady Bracknell often delayed making judgments about men due to their mysterious and complex rules, but no woman was ever unaware of how to speak her mind.
What they say is that if Richard followed his guidance and Hugh wrote for him, he would be sure that he is right in some way.
That's why Hugh let his cigarette burn, now the child asked the first question, hesitated until they lit their cigarettes, and then said: ?
Mili is going to bring the papers.
The girl went out and came back to Rash.
He put the papers on the table and took out his notebook.
His silver pen, which he opened its lid, said that it has served him for twenty years.
Still, it was correct and intact.
It had shown it to its creators.
They said there is no reason.
Never worn out, he felt a sense of pride in the way his handwriting started with loops around the margins of the paper, and as he carefully wrote the capital letters, Richard Deloy felt a sense of pride in the emotions his pen expressed, reducing the language command to the simplest form of Lady Brutton's understanding to comprehend his intention. Lady Brutton felt this extraordinary transformation she was witnessing and knew that the editor of The Times would surely respect it.
He was kind.
He was persistent.
Richard said he had to take a risk.
Hugh suggested some phrases to respect people's feelings, so when Richard laughed, it's almost like saying, "So how do you think the right time has come..."
According to Richard, it seemed like nonsense and gibberish.
But of course, it had no harm...
The religion that we have for the dead and Hugh, in our opinion, continued the highest and greatest of their noblest feelings in alphabetical order, shook the cigarette ash from his collar and occasionally summarized the progress he had made until finally he read a draft of a letter that Lady Bruton had no doubt was a masterpiece.
Could it mean that his intention was expressed in such a way?
Hugh couldn't guarantee that the editor would publish this letter, but he was supposed to see someone at the lunch party.
It was here that Lady Bruten, who rarely showed any grace, swept all the laughter of Hugh's jokes under her dress and raised her hands to the air.
He didn't know what he could do if they weren't there.
They stood up.
And Richard Deloy, as usual, slowly went to take a look at the portrait of General because he intended to write the history of the Lady Brutton dynasty whenever he had a little free time.
And Millicent Broughton struggled with her family.
It is said that he left the painting he was looking at for later.
The intention was that his family consisted of military men, naval administrators, and men of action who fulfilled their duties.
Richard's first duty towards his country, he said, is to be a beautiful face and whenever his time comes.
All the documents for Richard are ready in Aldermaston, meaning the Labour Party government.
