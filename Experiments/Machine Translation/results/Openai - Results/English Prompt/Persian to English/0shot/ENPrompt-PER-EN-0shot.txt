In the heat and sands of India, the flowers and swamps of Africa, the outskirts of London, wherever the climate or the devil tempts human beings to slip from the straight path that is theirs, even in this very moment they are busy lowering the prayer mats, breaking the idols, and erecting their own gloomy faces in their place.
His name is Hamkish Gardani.
Weak-willed people create their own walls, being in love with influencing, imposing, praising and their own paradises that have become popular among the general public.
In Hyde Park Corner, a preacher stands by a flowerpot and delivers a sermon.
Complicated in Uncle Sefid, repentance is shown with the transformative clothing of brotherly love in factories and legislative assemblies; it offers help, but seeks power.
Opponents or dissidents are pushed aside with violence; he offers his good wishes to those who, with their heads held high, obediently avert their gaze from his eyes.
This lady, Rosalind Warren Smith, found her way into William's heart, although she was hidden in such a way that she often appeared in disguise, a justified and noble love beyond selflessness.
Ready to do what?
What efforts it takes to secure financial resources and establish institutions to promote terminology.
But the goddess of strictness loves the blood more than the brick and invites the human will to her delicate table.
Example of it is Lady Bird.
Fifteen years had passed.
There was nothing that could exactly be blamed on him, neither a scandal nor a controversy, only surrendering to his will was the result of William's strong determination.
His smile was sweet, and his arrival at Harley Street for dinner was quickly followed by eight to nine stages of feeding fifteen important guests from various soft and delicate specialties.
But the passage of the night was a very brief or perhaps painful entanglement, a nervous restlessness, a scattered confusion and perplexity that made something truly heartbreaking hard to believe.
The poor lady was lying.
Once upon a time, long ago, freely and unrestrainedly, he used to go fishing for rainbow trout.
More tired and worn out, she was ready to serve the thirst for power that ignited her husband's eyes with a seductive light. She gathered herself, compressed, diminished, pruned, and sat back, pulling her headscarf in a way that made it clear what had made that night unusual. All this pressure had built up on her head, which most likely attributed it to professional conversations or the exhaustion of an excellent doctor whose life, as Lady put it, is not her own but belongs to her patients. It was becoming an abnormal night.
As the guests struck ten o'clock, the atmosphere of Harley Street would be filled with an indescribable excitement, which would bring relief to those deprived of it, of course, except for its patients.
Here, in the gray room with paintings on the walls and expensive furniture, under the non-receiving frosted glass, they were watching him bulletproof in comfortable chairs. He was making strange movements with his hands to see them, quickly stretching them out to both sides of the aisle, to prove that he was in control of his affairs and not sick, in case the patient was stubborn.
This was where weak people would break down, cry, and surrender.
Others, inspired by God, knew which extreme madness they called William, the cursed fanatic, with even more arrogance in his own life, how and why they did it.
Why should they stay alive at all?
William replied that his life is his own.
Of course, Lady Bardshaw was hanging ostrich feathers over the stove, and even though she had a yearly income of twelve thousand, they were protesting.
But life has not bestowed such blessings upon us.
Accepted
They had understood the concept of proportionality.
Maybe, after all these words, there is no God involved at all.
Shoulder raised
Summary, except that whether to live or not to live is related to ourselves.
But they were making a mistake with this one.
William had a friend in Sari who taught him something there that William honestly admitted was a difficult art.
Understanding the coherence of affairs.
In addition to this, there was also their love; nobility; bravery; and this shining profession.
All of these have been firmly established in William's leadership.
If nothing comes out of them.
The police and the well-being and welfare of society were forced to call for their support, which showed great peace of mind. They will take care of me there in Sari, so that these anti-social shocks, which are mainly caused by the lack of good principles and values, can be controlled.
And then the goddess, who opposed being overwhelmed by desire, would strike her pure and indelible image in the privacy of others, would emerge from her hiding place and sit on her throne.
The naked accepted the sign of William's determination to defend the fallen and the helpless.
Machine Translation (MT) Output: Attack was being carried out.
I am swallowing.
People were suffocating.
It was this combination of determination, resolve, and humanity that made William so dear to his relatives, as they saw him sacrifice so much for his loved ones.
Emaratzia Warren Smith was walking down Harley Street, shouting that she didn't like that man.
For hours, they were dividing and subdividing the day of June into tiny pieces on Harley Street, proclaiming obedience, confirming authority, and reminding each other of the great advantages of mutual understanding and harmony, until the mass of time became so compressed that a clock, with a kind and brotherly gesture, announced that it was half past one.
It seems that Mr. Rugby and Loundiz would be delighted with the free provision of this information.
When you looked up, it seemed that each letter of their name was a place on the clock.
The semi-conscious thanked rugby and Loundis when they were informed that they had reached Greenwich's approval.
Hugh Whitbread was contemplating in front of the shop window, and of course, afterwards, he would update his wardrobe by purchasing rugby socks or shoes from Rigby and Lundis.
His thoughts were like this.
He was used to it.
It did not go deep.
On the surface, life in Constantinople, Paris, and Rome is as lively as shooting, tennis, and riding.
The enemies claimed that now the tail of the palace, with the silk stockings of Kingham, is either up or down, it is not clear what it does.
But he was doing this job perfectly.
Fifty-five years ago, the highest layer of British society was submerged.
The prime ministers had seen.
They said that his emotions are deep.
If it were true that he had not participated in any of the major movements of the time or was not important in any significant position, he would have had the honor of a few brief reforms.
One of them was improving public shelters.
Protecting the fireflies
One of the other maidservants owed her.
His name, through his letters to the Times newspaper, in which he had requested financial assistance, had called on people to protect, collect garbage, reduce smoke, and eliminate immoral acts in parks, inspiring respect.
He had a magnificent appearance when he paused for a moment.
When the bell rang, it was almost impossible for her to look at the socks and shoes with a critical eye and without shame, as if she was looking at the world from a high position, and at the same time she was wearing the clothes.
But he understood the commitments that come with wealth and carefully observed even the outdated formalities that added a certain quality to his character, something worthy of imitation, something that people remember about him.
Because it was never possible, for example, for Lady Brutton, who was twenty years old, to have lunch without someone bringing her a bunch of flowers and asking her about her brother in South Africa, even though Lady Brutton's secretary, Miss Rash, knew nothing about her brother's whereabouts.
Thank you, his situation is good in South Africa.
Lady Bracknell herself would have preferred to arrive at that very moment.
In fact, they saw each other face to face.
Lady Burton, of course, preferred Richard Dalloway.
The translation of "جنمیش بسیار بهتر بود" from Persian to English is "It was much better."
But he was not present to witness the humiliation of his beloved child.
He couldn't forget her love.
It was really very kind of you.
He didn't exactly remember what the case was.
But he had been extremely kind.
In any case, the difference between one man and another is not that much.
He had never understood why nonsense should be used to criticize people, something that Clarissa always did.
They would take them under the knife and stick them back together, Adam would be sixty-two years old, never.
With that gloomy and pretentious smile, she captured Hugh's laughter.
He said that no one else is supposed to come.
He had lured them with excuses to help him solve a problem.
But first, let's eat.
In this way, the silent and skillful users of closed aprons and white hats began their back and forth movements from the double doors, not that they were necessarily servants of a ceremonial series or a grand deception that the host women would bring in from one and a half to two o'clock. When the flow came to a halt with a wave of the hand, a deep illusion takes its place.
First of all, about food, it shouldn't be paid for.
Furthermore, the table extends itself with glass jars and silverware under small plates, filled with red fruits, fish scales under cream-colored covers, shredded chickens in dishes, floating in non-domestic colored fire, burning with unpaid wine and coffee, joyful images are captured in front of the thoughtful eyes.
Soft eyes in search of eyes that see life as music, mysterious eyes that sparkle with electricity and become witness to beauty with the touch of love, turning into red laughter, which Lady Brute, whose movements were always dry, had placed next to her plate.
As Hugh Whitbread, who was completely confident in his position, placed his fork down, he asked, "In such a way that the whole world was sleek and yet completely secure in its position, right?"
If they are next to you, they won't stand out.
The girl was tired of being herself when she went to Rasht.
In his opinion, he was a man without origin or lineage.
Her words made Lady Burton laugh.
Lady Burton picked up the mushrooms.
Almost shocked and amazed, they remained fascinated as the general, in the same order as he had taken the map from behind him, took hold of them.
Richard Deloy asked himself, "By the way, what was the result, General?"
Nabireh General?
The head was in a head miles away in his own thoughts.
It was strange that the resemblance continued among the women in this family.
Lady Bruton herself should become General Saw in the system.
And Richard also served him willingly under his command.
He respected her deeply.
He had romantic thoughts about an old woman with a good pedigree and physique, and he didn't mind bringing some of his fiery young acquaintances with their special charm to her lunch party.
It seems that a personality like him could be nurtured from a well-brewed tea in the chest!
He explored his bucket and land.
People knew him.
How long was it still rumored that Louis or Harry never read poetry themselves, but it was heard that they were sitting under it.
It is better for him to wait before discussing the matter that had been bothering him with them, about seeking help from others, and if he does so, how and from these words.
Lady Porten said in the middle that it is better to wait until they finish their coffee, so she put the napkins aside.
How is Clarissa?
Suddenly he asked, "Why?"
Larisa always said that Lady Burton doesn't like her.
In fact, Lady Beyshah is more interested in politics.
He speaks to people like the dead, his foot is in a disgraceful conspiracy in the decade of existence, which was just beginning to appear gradually in the written memories of others.
Undoubtedly, there was a throne in his reception room, and there was a table in that throne, with a picture of General Talbot Moore on it, who had already passed away. Perhaps at that time in the evening, in the decade of the 10th century, in the presence of Lady Bruton, with her enthusiasm, he may have written a telegram, possibly at her recommendation, and issued the order for the advance of the British troops in a historic incident.
She still had the pen in her hand and it was difficult for husbands to know how Clarissa was: she was telling the story.
For this reason, when he talked about his complicated method, they would persuade their spouses and, in fact, no matter how much the leader himself doubted that he had any interest in women who often took the lead in their husbands' affairs, they would prevent them from accepting foreign guests and they had to take them to Clarissa in the middle of the parliamentary session by the sea to treat their influenza.
However, women knew well that his question, "go and come back", was a sign of a nearly silent companion who may have said ten or twelve words throughout a lifetime, narrating a story of feminine recognition under masculine lunch parties. Lady Bruton and Mrs. Dalloway, who rarely saw each other, and when they did, they appeared indifferent and even hostile, formed a unique alliance.
Hugh Whitbread was restless about the women's feast. This small token of appreciation from himself was enough to bring him to London and see everyone together. But his desire for Rashid, a greedy man who was one of the greediest men he had ever known, said in his heart that he would finally take men under his firm supervision and not scratch the knot that was there, completely useless from any feminine charm, with the capacity for eternal guardianship, especially to his fellow men.
Do you know who is in the city?
Suddenly, Lady Burton thought carefully and said.
Old friend of ours, Peter Walsh.
Everyone smiled.
Peter Walsh!
And Milli said to Rash, "Mr. Delawi is also very happy from the bottom of his heart, and Mr. Whitbread is only thinking about his chicken."
All three ladies, Brontë, Hewitt, and Deloitte, remembered one thing.
Peter, who was in love with Shiva, had his request rejected, went to India, was heartbroken, and had ruined everything.
Richard Deloy loved this dear old friend so much.
Milly saw it in Amphi's coffee-colored eyes, she saw that he was contemplating, evaluating that Barrish was interesting, so much so that Mr. Deloy always wondered what he was thinking about Peter Walsh?
That Peter Walsh has been in love with Clarissa, that immediately after lunch he goes and finds Clarissa, that Septimus and his broken skin tell him that he loves her.
Yes, that's exactly what he was saying.
There was nothing left when Milli fell in love with these silences and Mr. Delvoy was always very reliable, and so was Mr. Aghamansh.
At the age of forty, Lady Burton was enough to turn her head or spin it a little quickly.
Milly, no matter how deeply immersed in these spiritual contemplations, her soul remains intact, as life could not deceive her, as life, with its smallest value, did not give her anything, neither a curl of hair, nor a smile, nor a cheek, nor a nose, nor any sign. It was enough for Lady Bruton to move her head slightly to tell Perkins to bring the coffee sooner.
Yes, Peter Walsh has returned, Lady Burton said he had come back.
Pride satisfied everyone, whether you understood it or not.
Translation: They, broken and unsuccessful, have reached the safe shores.
You cannot help him with yourself.
There is a flaw in his character.
Hugh Whitbread said that of course it is possible that my old friend ordered it from so-and-so.
Selfish sorrow from the thought of the memos that should have been written to the heads of government agencies and the fact that their essence has been distorted in these words.
But he didn't get anywhere, he remained somewhere because of his personality.
A woman has gotten into trouble, Porten said.
Everyone guessed and assumed that the essence of the matter must be exactly this.
In any case, you will hear the whole story from Peter himself.
They had taken a long time to bring the coffee.
Address
Hugh Whitbread whispered under his breath.
I will wait for Mr. Whitbread to finish his work so that they bring the coffee.
Lady Burton said that Hugh is very generous.
He realized that he is getting fat.
Richard always looks at himself in the mirror.
English translation: He was getting tired.
His whole being seemed to resist the overwhelming dominance of the swirling present. He brushed aside all these unnecessary details of Peter Walsh and his relationships, from the subject that had preoccupied him.
Not only his attention, but also that field which had become the soul of his existence, that vital part of him without which he couldn't be Millicent Brotten.
The same project of migrating young people of both genders from respectable parents and establishing them with suitable opportunities for progress in Canada.
Exaggerating
Maybe he had lost his understanding of the proportion of things.
Migration was not a simple solution or a brilliant idea for others.
In their opinion, whether in the view of Hugh or Richard or even Miss Rash, the liberation did not free them from their selfishness.
A strong and determined woman with proper upbringing, Lady Bruton asked for the right way to handle explicit emotional upheavals, with firmness and inner strength, a little bit of clarity and simplicity.
Why can't everyone be straightforward and simple?
English translation: As his youth passed, he feels something rising within him.
He must find freedom, whether through migration or voluntary movements, but whatever it is, this thing that the essence of his soul exudes every day, becomes transparent without any harm. It is a half-mirror, half-precious stone, sometimes hidden carefully so that people do not mock it, and sometimes proudly displayed.
In summary, migration was mainly led by Lady Burton herself.
But he had to write.
And writing a letter to The Times, as usually called Miss Rash, asking her about organizing the dispatch of forces to South Africa, which was ordered and had a high cost during the war.
After a whole morning, she felt the futility of being a woman in such a way that she had never felt in any other situation, and she thought about Hugh Whitbread with a sense of entitlement that no one could question.
The owner wrote an art letter to the Times.
The natural inventory was so different from him, with such dominance over language, capable of presenting the problem in a way that editors liked, with desires that he couldn't free himself from and named it "Az".
Lady Burton often delayed judging men's mysterious behavior with the laws of the world, but no woman knew how to speak their language.
What they say is that if Richard followed his guidance and Hugh wrote for him, he would be sure that he is right in some way.
That's why he let Hugh eat his soufflé, the little child asked the first one, confirmed it until they lit their cigarettes and then said: ?
It is desirable to bring the papers.
The girl went out to Rasht and came back.
He put the papers on the table and took out his notebook.
His silver pen, which he opened the door with, said that it has served him for twenty years.
Still, he/she was healthy and sound.
It had shown it to its creators.
They had said there is no reason.
Never worn out, Hugh was proud in a way, and just as he began to carefully write the capital letters on the margins of the paper with loops around them, Richard Deloy felt the pride of emotions expressed by his pen in the most subtle way of Lady Brutton's mysteries to understand his intention, he reduced the language command so that Lady Brutton felt this extraordinary transformation that she was watching, the editor of Time magazine must respect it.
He was slow.
He was persistent.
Richard said that we should take a risk.
Hugh suggested some modifications to respect people's emotions, so when Richard laughed, it's almost like, therefore, how do we believe the appropriate time has come...
According to Richard, it seemed like nonsense and gibberish.
But of course, it had no harm...
The religion that we have for the dead and he, in our opinion, the highest and greatest of their feelings, continued in alphabetical order. He shook the cigarette ash from his jacket and summarized the progress he had made until finally he read a draft of a letter that Lady Brontë had no doubt was a masterpiece.
Does it mean that his intention could have been expressed like this?
Hugh couldn't guarantee that the editor would publish this letter, but he was supposed to see someone at the lunch reception.
It was here that Lady Burton, who rarely showed any delicacy, brought all the laughter to a halt and raised her hands in the air.
He didn't know what he could do if they weren't there.
They stood up.
And Richard Deloy, as usual, went slowly to take a look at the portrait of General, as he intended to write the history of the Lady Bruton's family whenever he had a little free time.
And Millicent Brouten jumped hard to her family.
The painting he was looking at, it is said, he left for later.
His intention was that his family members, who were military men, naval commanders, and men of action, had fulfilled their duties.
Richard's first duty towards his country, he said, but it is a beautiful face and whenever its time comes.
All the documents are ready for Richard in Aldermaston. His intention was the Labour Party government.
